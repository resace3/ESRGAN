### Test models
1. Clone this github repo. 
```
git clone https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN
cd ESRGAN
```
2. Place your own **low-resolution images** in `./LR` folder. (There are two sample images - baboon and comic). 
3. Download pretrained models from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/17VYV_SoZZesU6mbxz2dMAIccSSlqLecY) or [Baidu Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1-Lh6ma-wXzfH8NqeBtPaFQ). Place the models in `./models`. We provide two models with high perceptual quality and high PSNR performance (see [model list](https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN/tree/master/models)).
4. Run test. We provide ESRGAN model and RRDB_PSNR model and you can config in the `test.py`.
```
python test.py
```
5. The results are in `./results` folder.
### Network interpolation demo
You can interpolate the RRDB_ESRGAN and RRDB_PSNR models with alpha in [0, 1].

1. Run `python net_interp.py 0.8`, where *0.8* is the interpolation parameter and you can change it to any value in [0,1].
2. Run `python test.py models/interp_08.pth`, where *models/interp_08.pth* is the model path.
